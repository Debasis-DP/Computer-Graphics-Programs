# Computer-Graphics-Programs

### This repository included variety of Computer Graphics program source files. 

### The library used is OpenGL and the codes were written in C

### All the programs were developed in Visual Studio using FreeGlut and Glew.

### Topics included : 

* Sample OpenGL prgram to draw a pixel.
* Simple Flag designing.
* Line drawing algorithms like DDA, Bressenham and their modified algorithms also.
* Mid point algorithm to draw Circle, Ellipse and 2D Globe.
* Simple and Composite Transformations
* Curves like Plane Curve, Space Curve, Bezier Curve, Hermite Curve.
* Indian Flag drawing using Cubic Bezier Surfaces.

P.S. The procedure for configuring Glew and Glut in Visual Studio can be found [here](https://youtu.be/8p76pJsUP44)
